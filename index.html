  <h2><u>General Info About Me</u></h2>
  <p style="font-size:115%;">I was born on December 2, 1998, in Augusta, GA. I lived there for 18 years, until I moved to Athens. The map below shows Augusta's location in Georgia. I was raised as a Christian. I graduated from Lakeside High School in May 2017. I am currently a freshman at UGA, majoring in Accounting and minoring in German. I live in the freshman dorms on campus. As you can tell from the picture linked below, I am white, have long brown hair, have brown eyes, and always wear a hat (The link is located under the map. Instagram doesn't allow the usage of iFrames, so I had to use a normal link. I am the person in the middle).  </p>

  <h2><u>My Interests</u></h2>
  <p style="font-size:115%;">Although I am very busy with schoolwork, I still have interests and hobbies outside of studying. I started playing tennis when I was 8 years old, and played all four years of high school, where we won two state championships. (The link after this paragraph highlights my team's success.) I also like to lift weights. I am typically in Ramsey six days per week. </p>
